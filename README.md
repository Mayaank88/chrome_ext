<h1>Chrome Extension App</h1>
<h2>A sort of Leads Tracker App.</h2>
<p>This is a Chrome Extension App that I've build using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. So what it basically does is let's suppose you operate a investment banking firm and you are looking for some clients( here we call them as leads ) who are some potential coustomer for your firm. Now this app comes into play. </p>

<p>Here are some basic functionalities of this website/app:- <br>
1. It has three buttons: • SAVE INPUT  • SAVE TAB  • DELETE ALL <br> 
2. The SAVE INPUT BTN is used when we have to save a lead in the local storage. <br>
3. Let's suppose you are on someones LinkedIn profile and you want to directly save the link. Here you can use the SAVE TAB BTN. <br>
4. While saving all these , now you want to delete all the leads . Here you can leverage the DELETE BTN ( but you have to double click on it to make it work ). <br></p>

Things I've learned while building this project :-
1. DOM manipulation.
2. assinging local storage.
3. returning the value.
4. double click funtioning in JS (with the help of stack overflow).
5. how to use google as a helper while coding (especially stack overflow).
6. how to deploy any website in a browser.
7. JSON.
